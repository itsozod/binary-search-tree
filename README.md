 Bunary Search Tree (BST)

 <h1>Skill learned: Creating a Binary Search Tree (BST) and adding values to it</h1>
 <h3>Featues</h3>
<ol>
<li>Build a <code>Node</code> class / factory. It should have an attribute for the data it stores as well as its left and right children</li>
<li>Build a <code>Tree</code> class / factory which accepts an array when initialized. The <code>Tree</code> class should have a <code>root</code> attribute which uses the return value of <code>buildTree</code> which you’ll write next</li>
<li>Write a <code>buildTree</code> function which takes an array of data (e.g. [1, 7, 4, 23, 8, 9, 4, 3, 5, 7, 9, 67, 6345, 324]) and turns it into a balanced binary tree full of <code>Node</code> objects appropriately placed (don’t forget to sort and remove duplicates!). The <code>buildTree</code> function should return the level-0 root node</li>
<li>Write a <code>insert</code> and <code>delete</code> function which accepts a value to insert/delete</li>
<li>Write a <code>findValue</code> function which accepts a value and returns the node with the given value</li>
<li>Write a <code>leverOrderTraversal</code> function which accepts another function as a parameter, it should traverse tree in a breadth-first level order</li>
<li>Write <code>inorderTraversal</code>, <code>preOrderTraversal</code> and <code>postOrderTraversal</code> functions which each of these functions should traverse the tree in their respective depth-first order</li>
<li>Write a <code>height</code> function which accepts a node and returns its height. Height is defined as the number of edges in longest path from a given node to a leaf node</li>
<li>Write a <code>depth</code> function which accepts a node and returns its depth. Depth is defined as the number of edges in path from a given node to the tree’s root node</li>
<li>Write a <code>prettyPrint</code> function to visualize the tree in console</li>
<li>Write <code>isBalanced</code> function to check if tree is balanced</li>
<li>Write <code>rebalance</code> function to balance the tree if it is not</li>
</ol>
